TODO
--
- All TODOs in code
- Button does not function correctly when run from Game.py
    - problem with global variables- make designated launcher class
- Structures can only be in one chunk (and overwrite each other all the time)
	- also messes up entity generation
- Pause game when opening GUIs (like inventory)
    - Pause game at all
- Finish magic staff
- Player animation
- Block breaking particles
- Block preview visualization is a bit off- probably due to use of outline
- Possibly render foreground water as semitransparent (so it goes over block breaking image)
- Make sharpened flint more effective on kelp
- Chests
    - remove * rendering (after entity generation is fixed)
    - Stack with same data, or not at all
- Inventory
    - Armor
- Texture improvements:
	- Font
	- Basalt
	- Game icon
	- Block breaking animation
		- crop to CTM
	- Kelp border?
	- Make dirt tiles a bit wider so corners don't look weird
	- Borders?
		- Pros: already on character/items, make some things clearer
		- Cons: not on blocks yet, make drops look bad
- Folder for item .py files
	- need to change how they are imported
- Make image loading only happen once ever (for itemdrops especially)
	- Don't render giant blocks in player's hand- use BlockDrop versions
- Right click to halve stack
- Scroll to insert single
- Render player in corner of player inventory, chest by chest inventory, etc.
- WAILA
- Player:44 throws exception when collecting dropped itemstack? (dropping itemstack in wrong chunk?)
