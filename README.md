TODO
--
- Port to Monogame
    - just try rendering 2 layers of tiles
- Worldgen redo
    - Biomes
        - Choose biome based on chunk
            - Multiple 1d Perlin noise functions
                - Since using just 1 will cause biomes to always be sandwiched between same partners
                - Temperature, liveliness?
        - prescriptive (base height on biome)
            - Terrain scale
            - Surface material cutoffs
            - Gradients (done)
	    - Smooth transitions between biomes
            - vertically- heights
            - horizontally- mix blocks together?
            - transition minibiomes?
    - Decorations
        - 1d Perlin noise? or just seeded random?
        - Might allow for multi-chunk structures
            - check if adjacent chunk would have a structure
            - need to prevent same structure from spawning in a bunch- local maximum?
    - Ores, etc.
        - 2d Perlin noise
    - What is at the center (bottom) of the world?
        - hot impassible water?
        - solid rock?
        - lava?
    - Figure out how to make it use seed
    - Multithreading
- All TODOs in code
- Structures can only be in one chunk (and overwrite each other all the time)
    - also messes up entity generation
    - structures across multiple chunks with perlin noise?
- Block breaking particles
- Block preview visualization is a bit off- probably due to use of outline
- Possibly render foreground water as semitransparent (so it goes over block breaking image)
- Make sharpened flint more effective on kelp
- Chests
    - remove * rendering (after entity generation is fixed)
- Inventory
    - Armor
- Texture improvements:
    - Font
    - Basalt
    - Game icon
        - also make this load during startup, not world creation
    - Block breaking animation
        - crop to CTM- pipes are really noticeable
    - Dark colored borders
- Favorite items so they don't get mass-transferred (or dropped?)
- Player:44 throws exception when collecting dropped itemstack? (dropping itemstack in wrong chunk?)
- Click outside of inventory or press R to drop item in world
- Sliding puzzle lock
    - 3x3 version
    - test solution checking
- Pipes
    - Transfer items- how?
    - CTM variations: solid, sametype
- Move basic item attributes (attack damage, break speed, harvest level) to JSON with defaults
- Move JSON parsing to separate module, it doesn't belong in World
- Structures with background- define characters to be pairs of foreground and background blocks
- Enemies drop healing hearts when killed
- When player is hurt, make the whole player image flash red
- Menus
    - Better text fields
        - show cursor
        - tab to go to next one
        - filter invalid keypresses (is this done already?)
        - arrow keys, shift, home/end, mouse click, etc. to change cursor
    - Scroll wheel scrolls world list
    - Validate name in world creation
    - More options
        - Key bindings
    - Delete world button (& confirm dialog)
- Player can spawn inside generated structure and get stuck
- CTM rendering is slow- figure out some solution for large contiguous masses
- Keybinding (first in config, then in game menu)
    - Controller support
- DamageSourceStab and spear- hitbox around tip of spear
- Add reach attribute to items (just weapons)
- Render rotating attacks
    - arm- blit separate arm part onto item image? and don't render arm
    - Offset attack when swimming?
- Player jumps between swimming and stopped images while slowing down while hitting a block
- Scroll wheel click to pull out targeted block from inventory (or scroll to it if in hotbar)
- Bounding box issues
    - Moving right on the ground keeps standing anim
    - Player's head can clip into blocks on bottom or right corners
    - Keep swimming animation while key is held down (so player can slide into 1 block hole)?
    - Left and right animations for swimming up and down
- Press (or hold?) CTRL to switch to raycast-closest-hit mode (for mining a tunnel)
- Unpickling messes up inter-object references
    - DamageSourceSweep item and parent
- Clamp to grid issues
    - Player doesn't naturally align to grid against a horizontal block collision (can bump into block by holding down key)
    - Player can clip up/down into blocks
- Icon should load with main menu, not World
- Pixel scale
    - Add pixel scale to options menu
        - any problems when changing dynamically?
    - Make world load menu background work with any scale
    - Performance is awful with scale = 1
- CTM slowness
    - only change block image when updating adjacent in 8 sides?
    - also auto-generate CTM images from center, corners, edges, inside corners
