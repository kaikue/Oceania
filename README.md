Written in Pygame.

TODO
--
- Button does not function correctly when run from Game.py
    - problem with global variables- make designated launcher class
- Structures can only be in one chunk (and overwrite each other all the time)
- Pause game when opening GUIs
    - Pause game at all
- Figure out why spawn chunks don't save
- Block rendering
    - Redo according to Kenney's triangle system? or full CTM
    - Mask with solid magenta triangle(s), then set that as transparent
- Fix connected texture block drops rendering the whole image (just pick the center one) as well as in inventory
- Fix player can place blocks on top of entities
    - should be fixed now
- Chests
    - break entity when breaking chest- keep it associated with itemstack
        - chests shouldn't stack to more than 1
    - place entity with itemstack when player places block
    - generate entity only once (when block is crafted/generated) then keep it attached to item
- Background tiles
    - tiles are darkened and overlaid with water image
- Inventory
    - Mouse movement of items
- Find a real basalt texture
- Firgure out why water doesn't show background anymore (make image alpha?)
