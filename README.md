TODO
--
- All TODOs in code
- Button does not function correctly when run from Game.py
    - problem with global variables- make designated launcher class
- Structures can only be in one chunk (and overwrite each other all the time)
	- also messes up entity generation
	- structures across multiple chunks with perlin noise?
- Pause screen (can just be a GUI)
- Finish magic staff
- Player animation
- Block breaking particles
- Block preview visualization is a bit off- probably due to use of outline
- Possibly render foreground water as semitransparent (so it goes over block breaking image)
- Make sharpened flint more effective on kelp
- Chests
    - remove * rendering (after entity generation is fixed)
    - Stack with same data, or not at all
- Inventory
    - Armor
- Texture improvements:
	- Font
	- Basalt
	- Game icon
	- Block breaking animation
		- crop to CTM
	- Dark colored borders
- Mod support (additional classes & jsons in mod folder)
- Make image loading only happen once ever (for itemdrops especially)
	- Don't render giant blocks in player's hand- use BlockDrop versions
- Shift click on inventory transfer buttons to smart transfer?
- WAILA
- Player:44 throws exception when collecting dropped itemstack? (dropping itemstack in wrong chunk?)
- Esc to pause or close GUI
- Sliding puzzle lock
	- 3x3 version
	- test solution checking
- Raycast block breaking and mine closest one instead
- Pipes
	- Transfer items- how?
	- CTM variations: solid, sametype
- Move basic item attributes (attack damage, break speed, harvest level) to JSON with defaults
- Move JSON parsing to separate module, it doesn't belong in World
